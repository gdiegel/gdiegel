I'm a software engineer with a passion in cloud-native software development, continuous delivery and automated acceptance testing.

Here are some of the things that I feel make me a good engineer:

* What matters most to me is the code, I strive to perfection and take pride in my work
* I have a bias for action. When I see a problem, I solve it.
* I am a tinkerer and when others have already given up I will solve the problem
* I am opinionated and not afraid to speak my mind
* I show initiative, write articles and love to share knowledge
