### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a passion for Cloud-native Software Development, Continuous Delivery and Automated Acceptance Testing.

Here are some of the things that I feel make me a well-rounded engineer:

* What matters most to me is the code, I strive to perfection and take pride in my work
* I have a bias for action. When I see a problem, I solve it.
* I am opinionated and not afraid to speak my mind
* I show initiative, write articles and love to share knowledge
